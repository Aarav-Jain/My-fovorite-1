            <P>Books are our real friends. They are our guides. We can learn everything from them. The books contain all the great thoughts of our world and we can learn them by reading the books. The books help us find answers to our questions. The books never fail us.
                . Books are a good source of information, where we can find the information in a written and pictorial form. In the beginning years, they use to be in a handwritten form which slowly changed into a printed one. They contain various types of information and are the best form of storing knowledge. In the old days, there was no internet and books were the only source of information. Even today we read books, we have books each from a different subject in schools and we enjoy reading them. Reading books is a very good habit and we should always promote reading.</P>
